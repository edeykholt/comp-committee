Set the price of RHOC when the Coop is compensating the pay for board members and bonuses (not vaildator sales).

1. Collaborate with Finance & Audit Committee in regards to price of RHOC.
2. VIP of Finance (position currently vacant) can make the road map.
    1. Dror: Who would approve this road map? Membership, management or board?

**Criteria for Compensation Committee Members**

1. RChain Compensation Committee Rules ([link](https://github.com/rchain/comp-committee/blob/master/Rules_2018-02-03.md))
2. Kenny Rowe would like to remove himself from this committee - specifically as chair. He informed the members about the W3C governance. If we give the chair terms then we need an election process. According to the W3C structure, the groups would be established and the board appoints the chair. The chair for each committee is responsible for the health of each group. If the group felt that the chair was being irresponsible then this group can go to the board to appoint another chair.
    1. Ashley Careaga suggest Jason Plepel be appointed chair. 
3. All in favor of the Compensation Committee consisting of 7 members (odd number) with 3 staff members maximum and 4 non staff members.
