# CHARTER OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE (draft)

The compensation committee is a standing committee of the RChain Cooperative (RCC). This charter specifies the scope of the responsibilities of this committee and the manner in which the committee is to perform those responsibilities.

**Purpose**

The purpose of this committee is to discharge the responsibilities of the board relating to overseeing
  1. RCC's compensation philosophy, policies, plans and practices;
  2. the compensation of members of the board and the executive officers of RCC;
  3. the periodic review of the performance of RCC's CEO relative to goals and objectives related to compensation; and
  4. executive officer succession planning and RCC's leadership development efforts.

**Compensation Philosophy**

RCC's compensation policies with respect to the executive officers of RCC are based on principles designed to attract and retain qualified personnel through an overall level of compensation opportunity that is competitive within RCC's industry and to encourage achievement of RCC's goals by providing compensation programs that directly relate to the performance of the individual within the context of RCC's values, operating principles, and strategic plans. A quorum is a majority of the committee members.

**Committee Membership and Organization**

Membership on the committee is to be determined by the board upon the recommendation of the governance committee. The committee should be composed of three or more non-employee members, each of whom will serve until his or her successor is duly appointed by the board or his or her earlier resignation or removal. The board may remove a member of the committee at any time with or without cause and may appoint any non-employee trustee to fill any vacancy on the committee. 

The board may designate a chairperson of the committee. If a chairperson has not been designated by the board, the members of the committee may designate a chairperson by majority vote of the full committee membership.

The committee may form and delegate authority to subcommittees when appropriate or to one or more members of the committee.

The committee may obtain advice or assistance from consultants, legal counsel, accounting or other advisers as appropriate to perform its duties and responsibilities. The fees and costs of any consultant or adviser engaged by the committee to assist the committee in performing its duties and responsibilities must be approved by the board chair and are to be borne by RCC.

**Committee Meetings**

The committee is to meet as often as it determines necessary or advisable to discharge its duties and responsibilities. The committee may establish its own rules and procedures for notice and conduct of its meetings so long as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of RCC's bylaws applicable to committees of the board.

The committee may invite any person whose presence the committee believes to be desirable and appropriate to attend and observe meetings of the committee. Individuals who are invited to attend meetings of the committee may not participate in any discussion or deliberation of the committee unless invited to do so by the committee chairperson and may not vote on any matter brought before the committee.

The committee should maintain minutes or other records of its meetings and activities. The committee is to make regular reports to the board concerning the meetings and activities of the committee.

**Committee Authority and Responsibilities**

The committee has the following authority and responsibilities, subject to any modification or additional authority as the board may approve from time to time:

-   The committee is to periodically review and advise the board concerning RCC's overall compensation philosophy, policies, plans and practices, including a review of both regional and industry compensation practices and trends.
-   The committee is to approve any modification of material importance to financial terms in RCC's labor contracts prior to RCC's “last and final” offer.
